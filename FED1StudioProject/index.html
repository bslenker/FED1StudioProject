        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            We are a small operation of local farmers that have come together to help the movement of new generations of families transitioning to the county to start farming. We have three tiers of classes to choose from: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  Visit our classes page to find out which one is best for you.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Choose Us</h2>
        <p>
            We have been there before.  Starting out is hard and can feel overwhelming. Don't worry we can help!  From the very basics of when and what to plant, to how to rewire a 1950's ford PowerMaster tractor we can aide you in furthing your dream of building a self sustaining, profitable farm.
