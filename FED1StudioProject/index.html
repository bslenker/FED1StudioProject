            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Plowing. Plowing is what we do when we are preparing new beds for future use. We know this..Do you? So many young people these days are turning to the rural life after having no connection to it in their family. Traditionally farming was a passed down tradition from parents to children.  Lately we have seen a lot of greenhorns starting out on thier own for the first time. So if you don't know anything about the angle of the plough blade and how to get the best soil turnover, come on out and see what it's about!

                We have a very diverse team here at Burning Barn Farms, and we are just excited to meet you! Please feel free to reach out to us to learn more about the farm and our amazing staff.

                <h3>Tractor Love</h3>
                <p>
                    Tractor love is something all farmers have. We love the ability to make our work easier with machinery which saves us time and a lot of backaches.  But don't forget about when that fancy tractor decides to break down. It has to be fixed, and fixed on a budget too. So why don't you save yourself some money in the long run and learn how to work on your own tractor! We have three different levels of classes for you to choose from ranging from beginner to advanced with some of the best shade tree mechanics in the county.

                <h3>Livestock Love?</h3>
                <p>
                   Do you want to have some livestock on that farm of yours? Maybe a chicken or Jackass or two?  Well we can set you on the right path. From how to water and feed efficently, to housing needs, and manure management for effiencent composting.  Learning to work with your livestock instead of against them will reward you in the long run with healthy, happy livestock.  And remember a happy livestock is a tastier livestock.
